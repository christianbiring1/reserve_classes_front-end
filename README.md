# Final group capstone - Book an Online class - Front-end

> Description

The project we built for the Final Capstone Project is based on an app to book an appointment to attend a online class. We had to follow the given design of the website, but we personalize the content, i.e., instead of booking an appointment to try a motorcycle, we built an app to book an appointment to attend a remote class with a teacher. This was highly encouraged since having unique projects in our portfolio will help us stand out while looking for jobs.
